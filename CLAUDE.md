# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**claude-in-docker** (CinD) is a Docker image for running Claude Code in an isolated container.

This project treats AI agents as untrusted contractors and aims to mitigate the risks associated with running AI agents directly on localhost.

## Claude-Code Behavioral Instructions

Always follow these guidelines for the given phase.

### Exploration Phase

When you run Explore:

- **DO NOT** spawn exploration agents unless explicitly asked to do so by the user. **Always explore everything on your own** to gain a complete and thorough understanding.

## Task Master AI Instructions

**IMPORTANT!!! Import Task Master's development workflow commands and guidelines, treat as if import is in the main CLAUDE.md file.**
